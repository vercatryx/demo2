/**
 * Billing by client: one entry per client (parent + all dependents).
 * Amount = 336 × people (non-Produce) or 146 × people (Produce). Based on parent service_type only.
 * Same JSON format as /api/extension/billing-requests.
 *
 * - Order list (`orderNumbers`): only orders NOT already marked billing_successful **and** whose
 *   effective delivery date (actual_delivery_date if set, otherwise scheduled_delivery_date) falls
 *   within the 7-day window (?date through date+6).
 * - Proof URLs:
 *   - Prefer the parent’s signature PDF when `sign_token` is set (`/api/signatures/{token}/pdf`).
 *   - Otherwise (no sign_token), use up to 2 photo proofs from orders: prefer orders whose delivery date
 *     falls within the 7-day window (?date through date+6); if none in-window, use the 2 most recent
 *     proofs across **all** that household’s orders (including outside the window).
 * - Unite Us `url`: parent client's case_id_external / client_id_external only (not copied from orders).
 *
 * GET /api/bill
 * Query params:
 *   ?date=YYYY-MM-DD   – billing window start (default 2026-02-23)
 *   ?account=regular|brooklyn|both  – filter by unite_account (default: both)
 *   ?onlyreal=1       – only households with ≥1 order (effective delivery) in the 7-day window
 * Excludes parent clients with clients.bill === false (same as app “no billing” / bill unchecked).
 * Archived clients are never included (parents or dependants), regardless of orders.
 * Each entry includes createdAt (ISO 8601) for the parent client and each dependant.
 * No auth required.
 *
 * For a fixed invoice-PDF proof URL per row, see GET /api/bill/invoices.
